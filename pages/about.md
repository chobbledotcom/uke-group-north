## Welcome to Uke Group North

We're a community interest company dedicated to bringing people together through the joy of music. Since September 2021, we've been running weekly workshops across Greater Manchester and Lancashire, creating spaces where people of all ages and abilities can learn, play, and connect through the ukulele.

## Our Story

Our journey began with a simple belief: that music has the power to transform communities. Starting with our first sessions at The Den in Ramsbottom, we've grown into a vibrant network of music-makers, bringing the joy of ukulele to libraries, community centres, and gathering spaces across the region.

We're proud to work alongside brilliant community organizations like the [RammyMen](https://rammymen.org), who celebrated a Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2022. Together, we're building stronger, more connected communities through music.

## What We Do

We deliver welcoming, group-oriented musical education workshops that focus on:

- **Doing something together** - Building community through shared experiences
- **Having fun** - Because learning should be joyful
- **Playing ukulele** - From first chords to advanced techniques
- **Singing** - Finding your voice in a supportive environment
- **Music theory** - Understanding the language of music
- **Performance** - Building confidence to share your music
