## Welcome to Uke Group North

We are a community interest company dedicated to bringing people together through the joy of music. Since September 2021, we've been running weekly workshops across Greater Manchester and Lancashire, creating spaces where people of all ages and abilities can learn, play, and connect through the ukulele.

## Our Story

Our journey begins with the belief: music has the power to help transform communities. Starting with our first sessions in Ramsbottom, we've grown into a vibrant network of welcoming, supportive, encouraging music-makers. Bringing the joy of music, ukulele and singing together to libraries, community centres, residential living centres, primary schools, museums, gardens and gathering spaces across the region with our workshops, sing and strum sessions and live performances.

We're proud to work alongside organisations who create positive ripples in communities such as [RammyMen](https://rammymen.org), [Urban Outreach](https://urbanoutreach.co.uk) as well as local councils and other care providers. 

## Our Objectives

**Wellbeing** - Improving mental and emotional health through music, routine and small circles of social-emotional reciprocity

**Community** - Creating welcoming spaces to strengthen & forge new community bonds and broadening the offering of community held spaces

**Inclusivity** - Everyone is welcome, regardless of background, age, ability or beliefs



## What We Do

We deliver welcoming, group-oriented fun musical education workshops that focus on:

- **Doing something together** - Building community through shared experiences
- **Having fun** - Because learning is better through play
- **Playing ukulele** - From first chords to advanced techniques
- **Singing** - Finding your voice in a supportive environment
