Music Workshops

Our weekly sing and strum workshops have been running since September 2021 with the brilliant[RammyMen, who with help from our own volunteer lead activities ](https://rammymen.org)celebrated a Queens Award for Voluntary Service in 2022. You can pop down to their Den in Ramsbottom on a Tuesday evening 5:30/7:30 for a relaxed easy going sing and a strum with us!
