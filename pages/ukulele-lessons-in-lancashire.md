## Getting Around Lancashire

Our sessions are all well connected across Lancashire's transport network. Ramsbottom has direct rail connections from Manchester and good road links via the A56. Bury is on the Metrolink system and has excellent bus connections throughout the county.

Many of our members travel from various Lancashire towns - Preston, Chorley, Wigan, and smaller villages across the county. The journey becomes part of the routine that people value, often carpooling with fellow members.

## Lancashire's Musical Heritage

Lancashire has a rich tradition of community music-making, from brass bands to folk songs. Our ukulele sessions continue this heritage in a modern, accessible way. We're proud to be part of Lancashire's musical story, bringing people together just as music has done in the county for generations.

The ukulele might not be traditional Lancashire, but the spirit of community music-making certainly is. Our sessions embody the Lancashire values of warmth, welcome, and pulling together.

## What Makes Our Sessions Special

We focus on playing and singing together using songbooks packed with popular tunes. Our facilitators understand that learning should be enjoyable - there's no pressure, just the pleasure of making music with others.

Whether you're from a busy Lancashire town or a quiet village, you'll find our sessions provide a space to connect with neighbours and make new friends across the county.

## Supporting Lancashire Communities

As a community interest company, we're committed to strengthening the community assets that make Lancashire special. Our sessions support local venues, create connections between people, and contribute to the wellbeing of communities across the county.

We work alongside other Lancashire organisations focused on community wellbeing, recognising that strong communities need spaces where people can come together regularly.

## What to Bring

## One-to-One Lessons

While group sessions are our main focus, if you're interested in individual tuition anywhere in Lancashire, please get in touch. We may be able to arrange private lessons or recommend local instructors.

## The Lancashire Spirit

There's something special about Lancashire - the warmth of the people, the strength of communities, the way neighbours look out for each other. Our ukulele sessions embody this spirit, creating spaces where the Lancashire tradition of community continues.

We've had members travel from all corners of the county because they've found something here that speaks to that Lancashire sense of belonging and mutual support.
