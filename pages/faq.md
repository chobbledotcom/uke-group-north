## Getting Started Questions

### Do I need any experience to join?

Not at all - we'll teach you everything from how to hold the ukulele to playing your first songs. Many of our members started as complete beginners. Complete beginners are especially encouraged! Visit our [workshops page](/workshops/) to see what we teach.

### Do I need to own a ukulele?

No! We provide high-quality instruments for FREE during sessions. Just let us know in your booking if you'd like to borrow one of ours. You can bring your own if you have one. See our [about page](/about/) for more about our inclusive approach.

### How much does it cost?

Our weekly Sing & Strum sessions cost £8 per person. There are no long-term commitments required, and block booking discounts are available. For one-to-one lessons with Ben, it's £20 for 30 minutes or £30 for 60 minutes. Learn more on our [home page](/).

### What age groups can attend?

No age limits at all. We've had everyone from children to folks in their 80s. Music brings all generations together. All ages and abilities are welcome. We also run specific [children's workshops](/workshops/) exploring the origins of the ukulele, the science of sound, and music fundamentals through games and activities.

### What should I bring to my first session?

- Your ukulele (or let us know if you'd like to borrow one of ours)
- Our songbook - download the [UGN Songbook (PDF)](/assets/UGN_Songbook_1.1.pdf) or the [Junior Songbook (PDF)](/assets/Junior_Songbook_2025.pdf), or bring it on a tablet
- Just yourself and a willingness to have some fun!

### Is ukulele hard to learn?

The ukulele is one of the most approachable instruments - easier than guitar to start with, but capable of beautiful music. As Jake Shimabukuro said, "If everyone played the ukulele, the world would be a better place. There's something about the ukulele that just makes you smile." Read more about [why choose ukulele](/) on our home page.

## What Makes Us Different?

### What makes Uke Group North different from other music classes?

We're a [Community Interest Company](/about/) (not-for-profit) dedicated to bringing people together through music since September 2021. We provide high-quality instruments for FREE, keep our prices affordable (£8 per session), and focus on building community connections as much as musical skills. Our sessions strengthen local community spaces while creating circles of support. We're proud to work alongside organisations like [RammyMen](https://rammymen.org) and [Urban Outreach](https://urbanoutreach.co.uk) as well as local councils and care providers.

### Are you a business or charity?

We're a Community Interest Company (CIC) - a special type of organisation that reinvests profits back into our community mission. Learn more about our structure and values on our [about page](/about/).

### What are your mission objectives?

We have three core objectives outlined on our [mission page](/our-mission/):

1. **Wellbeing** - Improving mental and emotional health through music, routine and small circles of social-emotional reciprocity
2. **Community** - Creating welcoming spaces to strengthen and forge new community bonds and broadening the offering of community held spaces
3. **Inclusivity** - Everyone is welcome, regardless of background, age, ability or beliefs

### What qualifications does Ben have?

Ben, our founder and group facilitator, has over 20 years of musical experience playing various instruments including piano, guitar and bass guitar. He spent nine years in a heavy metal band and performed at major festivals. Over the last 8 years, the ukulele has become his passion, bringing joy and positive distraction to many students and service users. His teaching style is friendly and laid-back, making him perfect for nervous beginners or those wanting to improve their technique. Read more on our [about page](/about/).

### Do you offer one-to-one lessons?

Yes! Ben offers one-to-one ukulele lessons for learners of all ages. He travels to your location within approximately 30 miles of Ramsbottom (which covers most of Greater Manchester and Lancashire), or can provide remote lessons via Zoom if you're located further away. Prices are £20 for 30 minutes or £30 for 60 minutes. Contact us via our [contact page](/contact/) to arrange personal tuition.

## Community & Wellbeing

### Can ukulele really help with mental health?

Yes! Music therapy has been recognised by NICE guidelines (UK) as beneficial for mental health, particularly in promoting recovery and alleviating negative symptoms. The structured rehearsal routines, learning new skills, and the expressive nature of music-making all contribute to improved mental wellbeing. Three Cochrane reviews have demonstrated the positive effects of music therapy, showing improvements in general symptoms including attention, motivation, and reduction of negative symptoms. Read more about the research on our [mission page](/our-mission/).

### Will I make friends at the sessions?

Our sessions are designed to build lasting friendships and support networks. We focus on doing something together, having fun, and creating a sense of belonging. As mentioned on our [about page](/about/), we've grown into a vibrant network of welcoming, supportive, encouraging music-makers. Many members have formed genuine friendships through our sessions.

### Is it good for reducing social isolation?

Absolutely. A sense of belonging is a fundamental human need, and our groups create a space to talk and share experiences, make connections with others in the community, and reduce feelings of social isolation. Our approach helps build and maintain informal circles of socioemotional reciprocity - small social circles that provide mutual support. Learn more about our [wellbeing objectives](/our-mission/).

### What community benefits do sessions provide?

Our sessions strengthen community buildings and spaces by improving the offering in community held spaces, contributing to their financial upkeep through regular bookings, and increasing user numbers and community engagement. With the declining number of community spaces, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe in the vital role these buildings play in maintaining communities, individual wellbeing, and social cohesion. Read about our [community objectives](/our-mission/).

## Practical Learning

### What will I learn in sessions?

Our sessions focus on playing and singing together with small, easily digestible portions of music theory to help you on your musical journey. You'll learn proper technique, chord progressions, and strumming patterns. Our [workshops page](/workshops/) outlines our comprehensive approach including:

- How to hold and tune your ukulele
- Basic chords (C, F, G, Am) and extended chord vocabulary
- Strumming patterns and percussive techniques
- Reading chord charts
- Playing melodies and harmonies

### Do you teach music theory?

Yes! We include small, easily digestible portions of music theory in our sessions. Our [children's workshops](/workshops/) explore the science of sound and the fundamentals of music, while our intermediate and advanced workshops cover music theory fundamentals, harmony, and song interpretation.

### What songs do you play?

Our songbooks include everything from folk classics to modern pop hits, all arranged for ukulele. You can download our free songbooks: [UGN Songbook (PDF)](/assets/UGN_Songbook_1.1.pdf) for our main collection and [Junior Songbook (PDF)](/assets/Junior_Songbook_2025.pdf) for younger players and beginners. Visit our [learn page](/learn/) for more resources.

### Can I learn at my own pace?

Absolutely! Sessions are tailored to include insightful content for complete novices and experienced musicians, ensuring everyone progresses at their own pace. We're experienced musicians who understand that learning should be enjoyable. Read more about our teaching approach on our [about page](/about/).

### Are there resources for learning at home?

Yes! We provide free downloadable songbooks and learning resources. Our [learn page](/learn/) includes guides on holding your ukulele, strumming technique, basic chords like C7, and even a fun first song called "Sea Seven" that you can play using just one chord. You can also book one-to-one lessons with Ben for personalised instruction at home.

## Social Considerations

### What if I'm nervous about joining?

That's completely normal! Everyone was new once, and we pride ourselves on being welcoming. We'll look after you and help you settle in. Our approach is relaxed and inclusive - no pressure, just the joy of making music together. Ben's teaching style is friendly and laid-back, making him perfect for nervous beginners. Read testimonials from our members on our [reviews page](/reviews/).

### Can I bring a friend or family member?

Of course! Many people come with partners, friends, or family members. The more the merrier. All ages are welcome, so whether you're bringing a child, parent, or friend, everyone will find a warm welcome.

### What's the atmosphere like?

Our sessions are relaxed, welcoming, and supportive. We create an atmosphere where everyone can contribute, regardless of skill level. The real magic happens when voices join together. As mentioned on our [about page](/about/), our workshops focus on doing something together, having fun, playing ukulele, singing, and building confidence to share your music. We believe learning is better through play!

## Commitment & Flexibility

### Do I need to commit long-term?

No! There are no long-term commitments required. You're welcome to attend as regularly or occasionally as works for you. We keep our approach flexible to suit your lifestyle.

### Can I try different sessions?

Absolutely! Some people attend multiple sessions regularly, others pick the one that suits their schedule best. All our sessions are equally welcoming, so feel free to try different ones to find your favourite.

### Are there block booking discounts?

Yes! Block booking discounts are available. Contact us via our [contact page](/contact/) or email ukegroupnorth@gmail.com to discuss block booking options.

### Can I attend multiple sessions per week?

Yes! You're welcome to attend as many sessions as you like. Some members attend multiple sessions throughout the week because they enjoy the community and want more practice time.

### Do you perform publicly?
