We focus on playing and singing together with small easily digestible portions of music theory to help you on your musical journey. Using our songbooks packed with popular tunes, we create an atmosphere where everyone can contribute, regardless of skill level. You'll learn proper technique, chord progressions, and strumming patterns, but the real magic happens when voices join together.

We are experienced musicians who understand that learning should be enjoyable. We provide instruments if you don't have your own. Sessions are tailored to include insightful content for complete novices and experienced musicians, ensuring everyone progresses at their own pace.

All our sessions are friendly and welcoming! Bury sessions are most convenient for Manchester residents - Thursday evenings suit those who work during the day, while Monday mornings are popular with retirees and flexible schedules. Ramsbottom sessions offer a lovely countryside escape.

**Do I need any musical experience?**
Not at all - we'll teach you everything from how to hold the ukulele to playing your first songs. Many of our members started as complete beginners.

**Can I try different sessions?**
Absolutely! Some people attend multiple sessions regularly, others pick the one that suits their schedule best.

**What if I miss sessions?**
Life happens - you're welcome to attend as regularly or occasionally as works for you. No long-term commitments required.

**Are there age limits?**
No age limits at all. We've had everyone from children to folks in their 80s. Music brings all generations together.

Bury sessions are perfect - just 30 minutes on the Metrolink. Ramsbottom is a scenic 30-45 minute journey by train or car.

It's one of the most approachable instruments - easier than guitar to start with, but capable of beautiful music. Plus, as Jake Shimabukuro said, "If everyone played the ukulele, the world would be a better place."
