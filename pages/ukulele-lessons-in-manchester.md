## What to Expect

Our sessions focus on playing and singing together in a supportive group environment. We use songbooks filled with popular tunes arranged for ukulele - everything from classics to contemporary hits. The atmosphere is friendly and encouraging, with plenty of laughter along the way.

You'll learn proper ukulele technique, chord progressions, strumming patterns, and singing skills. But more than that, you'll become part of a musical community that values connection and wellbeing.

## What to Bring

- Your ukulele (or let us know if you'd like to borrow one of ours)
- Our songbook - download the [UGN Songbook (PDF)](/assets/UGN_Songbook_1.1.pdf) or bring a tablet
