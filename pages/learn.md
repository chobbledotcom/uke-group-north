## The Basics

### Holding Your Ukulele

Getting comfortable with your instrument is the first step to making beautiful music.

**Two Points of Contact:**
1. **Neck** - Resting gently in your fretting hand
2. **Forearm** - Your strumming arm makes contact against the soundboard/lower bout

**Pro Tips:**
- Roll up your sleeves for extra grip with your strumming arm
- Adjust where your forearm makes contact to find your the "sweet spot" for striking the strings with your thumb or finger - usually around where the neck meets the body of the uke
- Remove watches, jewelry, or buttons that might get in the way
- Some professional ukulele players grow their nails on their strumming hand, but most will keep them short on their fretting hand.
- Breathe and relax, try to laugh off any mistakes, keep playing! :)

### A place to start: C7

C7 is a great place for beginners to start strumming. 
It has a memorable positioning for frets, strings and fingers.

**How to play C7:**
- Place your **1st finger**
- on the **1st fret**
- of the **1st string** (the string closest to the floor)

**Practice Technique:**
1. Start with a "feather touch" - barely touching the string
2. Slowly add pressure
3. Find the minimum pressure needed by plucking the 1st string gently with your strumming thumb

### Strumming Technique

Good strumming involves staying loose and relaxed.

**Basic Strumming Method:**
1. Let your wrist and hand relaxed and loose
2. Extend your index finger, let others curl naturally
3. **Strumming Down:** Use your fingernail or fingertip, extending your finger
4. **Strumming Up:** Use the pad of your finger, curling it back toward your palm
5. Use combined movement of wrist and finger - minimal elbow movement

## Advanced Techniques

### The Ukulele as a Little Drum

Your ukulele can be more than just a melodic instrument - it can be a percussive instrument too!

**Three Main Drum Sounds:**

#### 1. Hi-Hats
The basic sound of striking the strings - whether open, fretted, or dampened. This creates the "Tss-t-t" sound of hi-hats.

#### 2. Snare Drum - The Chuck!
Chucking is one of the most fun ukulele techniques!

**How to Chuck:**
- Dampen the strings with your fretting hand
- Strike the strings with your strumming hand
- Or use your palm to simultaneously dampen and attack
- Try adding chucks on beats 2 and 4 for a driving backbeat

#### 3. Bass Drum
- Strike the strings close to the saddle/bridge for a deeper sound
- If you have a pickup, add some reverb for extra "oomph"

### Practice Tips for Percussive Playing

- Start gentle - you can always build up
- Give chucks center stage - practice them without chords first
- Feel the rhythm and let it drive your playing
- Remember: The ukulele loves to pretend it's a drum!

## Our First Song: "Sea Seven"

Here's a fun little song you can play using just the C7 chord! Perfect for practicing your strumming while singing along.

**Sea Seven** *(Play with C7 throughout)*

*They're lined up in a row right here, they're called 1, 2 & 3  
And 4's a little neighbour, they're happy as can be  
They like to go to outer space, make music and explore  
You got the fire and got the time, then strum the strings all 4*

*I said [insert names of group members]!  
Is there something I can do?  
I said [another name]!  
To sail Sea Seven true?*

*They plot the stars they follow charts, the strumming hand commands  
There's others too that live with thumb, they're on your strongest hand  
They bring the uke to life chuckstrum, a place they can explore 
A root a 3rd a 5th sounds swell, a 7th you can't ignore!*

*(Continue with more names and verses as you like!)*
