## Getting Started with Ukulele

Welcome to our learning resources! Whether you're picking up a ukulele for the first time or looking to develop your skills, these guides will help you on your musical journey.

## The Basics

### Holding Your Ukulele

Getting comfortable with your instrument is the first step to making beautiful music.

**Two Points of Contact:**
1. **Neck** - Resting gently in your fretting hand
2. **Forearm** - Your strumming arm makes contact against the soundboard/lower bout

**Pro Tips:**
- Roll up your sleeves for extra grip with your strumming arm
- Adjust where your forearm makes contact to find your "sweet spot" - usually where the neck meets the body
- Hold the ukulele like you're holding a baby - firm but gentle!
- Remove watches, jewelry, or buttons that might get in the way

### Your First Chord: C7

Let's start with one of the easiest chords - C7!

**How to play C7:**
- Place your **1st finger** on the **1st fret** of the **1st string** (the string closest to the floor)
- That's it! Just one finger needed

**Practice Technique:**
1. Start with a "feather touch" - barely touching the string
2. Slowly add pressure until the note rings clear
3. Find the minimum pressure needed - too much can cause bad habits and even injury
4. Keep everything relaxed!

### Strumming Technique

Good strumming is all about staying loose and relaxed.

**Basic Strumming Method:**
1. Let your wrist and hand go nice and loose
2. Extend your index finger, let others curl naturally
3. **Strumming Down:** Use your fingernail or fingertip, extending your finger
4. **Strumming Up:** Use the pad of your finger, curling it back toward your palm
5. Use combined movement of wrist and finger - minimal elbow movement

Remember: Practice gently! Every sound can be achieved through light playing. It's better to build up volume than be stuck at volume 11 with nowhere to go!

## Advanced Techniques

### The Ukulele as a Little Drum

Your ukulele can be more than just a melodic instrument - it can be a percussion instrument too!

**Three Main Drum Sounds:**

#### 1. Hi-Hats
The basic sound of striking the strings - whether open, fretted, or dampened. This creates the "Tss-t-t" sound of hi-hats.

#### 2. Snare Drum - The Chuck!
Chucking is one of the most fun ukulele techniques!

**How to Chuck:**
- Dampen the strings with your fretting hand
- Strike the strings with your strumming hand
- Or use your palm to simultaneously dampen and attack
- Try adding chucks on beats 2 and 4 for a driving backbeat
- Let your fingernail go beyond the strings to tap the soundboard for extra snap!

#### 3. Bass Drum
- Strike the strings close to the saddle/bridge for a deeper sound
- Tap different areas of the instrument body
- If you have a pickup, add some reverb for extra "oomph"

### Practice Tips for Percussive Playing

- Start gentle - you can always build up
- Give chucks center stage - practice them without chords first
- Feel the rhythm and let it drive your playing
- Remember: The ukulele loves to pretend it's a drum!

## Your First Song: "Sea Seven"

Here's a fun song you can play using just the C7 chord! Perfect for practicing your strumming while singing along.

**Sea Seven** *(Play with C7 throughout)*

*They're lined up in a row right here, they're called 1, 2 & 3  
And 4's a little neighbour, they're happy as can be  
They like to go to outer space, make music and explore  
You got the fire and got the time, then strum the strings all 4*

*I said [insert names of group members]!  
Is there something I can do?  
I said [another name]!  
To sail Sea Seven true?*

*They plot the stars they follow charts, the strumming hand commands  
There's others too that live with thumb, they're on your strongest hand  
They bring the uke to life chuck strum, a sound you can't ignore  
You have your own you know them well, you've played with things before!*

*(Continue with more names and verses as you like!)*
