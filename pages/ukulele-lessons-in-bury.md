## Ukulele Lessons in Bury

Bury is at the heart of our Uke Group North community! We run two weekly sessions right here in town, making it easy for local folks to join our musical family. Since 2021, we've been creating welcoming spaces where people of all ages can learn ukulele, sing together, and build lasting friendships.

Our sessions are relaxed and inclusive - no pressure, just the joy of making music together. Whether you're picking up an instrument for the first time or looking to play with others, you'll find your place here.

## Our Bury Sessions

### Thursday Evenings at Wyldes

Perfect for after work or evening learners, our Thursday sessions at Wyldes offer a cosy atmosphere in the heart of Bury.

- **When:** Every Thursday, 6:30pm-8pm
- **Where:** Wyldes, 4 Bolton St, Bury, BL9 0LQ
- **Cost:** £8 per person
- **Getting there:** Right in Bury town centre, easy walking distance from the Metrolink station

### Monday Mornings at Greenmount

Start your week with music! Our Monday morning sessions at Greenmount Old School Community Centre provide a lovely community setting.

- **When:** Every Monday, 10:15am-11:15am
- **Where:** Greenmount Old School, Brandlesholme Road, Bury, BL8 4DS
- **Cost:** £8 per person
- **Getting there:** Short bus ride from Bury centre, or easy drive with parking available

## Getting Around Bury

Both our venues are well connected within Bury. The Thursday sessions at Wyldes are right in the town centre - if you're coming by Metrolink from Manchester or other areas, it's just a few minutes' walk from Bury station.

For Greenmount, it's about 10 minutes by car from Bury centre, or you can catch a local bus. The community centre has its own car park, making it convenient for those driving.

## What Makes Our Sessions Special

We focus on playing and singing together rather than formal lessons. Using our songbooks packed with popular tunes, we create an atmosphere where everyone can contribute, regardless of skill level. You'll learn proper technique, chord progressions, and strumming patterns, but the real magic happens when voices join together.

Our facilitators are experienced musicians who understand that learning should be enjoyable. We provide instruments if you don't have your own, and nobody's left behind - everyone progresses at their own pace.

## Community Connections

As Bury locals ourselves, we understand the importance of community spaces. Our sessions help support local venues while creating connections between neighbours. We've seen friendships form, confidence grow, and people rediscover their love of music.

We're proud to work alongside other community organisations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire, all focused on bringing people together and improving wellbeing through shared activities.

## What to Bring

- Your ukulele (or let us know if you'd like to borrow one)
- Our songbook - download the [UGN Songbook (PDF)](/assets/UGN_Songbook_1.1.pdf) or bring it on a tablet
- Just yourself and a willingness to have fun!

## One-to-One Lessons

While group sessions are our main focus, if you're interested in individual tuition, please get in touch. We may be able to arrange private lessons or recommend local instructors in the Bury area.

## Why Choose Local Sessions?

Learning music in your own community has real benefits. You'll meet neighbours, support local venues, and have short travel times that make it easier to attend regularly. The routine of weekly sessions provides structure and something to look forward to.

As a community interest company, we're committed to making music accessible and affordable for everyone. Our sessions contribute to local wellbeing while strengthening the community assets that make Bury special.

## Book Your Place

Ready to join us? Email [ukegroupnorth@gmail.com](mailto:ukegroupnorth@gmail.com) to book your place at either of our Bury sessions. Spaces are limited to ensure everyone gets the attention they need, so booking in advance is recommended. Block booking discounts available.

All abilities welcome - complete beginners are especially encouraged!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Which session should I choose?**
Both sessions are friendly and welcoming! Thursday evenings suit those who work during the day, while Monday mornings are popular with retirees and those with flexible schedules.

**Do I need any musical experience?**
Not at all - we'll teach you everything from how to hold the ukulele to playing your first songs. Many of our members started as complete beginners.

**Can I try both sessions?**
Absolutely! Some people attend both regularly, others pick the one that suits their schedule best.

**What if I miss sessions?**
Life happens - you're welcome to attend as regularly or occasionally as works for you. No long-term commitments required.

**Are there age limits?**
No age limits at all. We've had everyone from children to folks in their 80s. Music brings all generations together.

**What about parking?**
Wyldes is in the town centre with nearby public parking. Greenmount Old School has its own car park.

**Do you perform publicly?**
Sometimes! We occasionally arrange small performances for local events, but it's always voluntary and relaxed.

**What songs do you play?**
Our songbooks include everything from folk classics to modern pop hits, all arranged for ukulele. There's something for every taste.

**Can I bring a friend or family member?**
Of course! Many people come with partners, friends, or family members. The more the merrier.

**What makes ukulele special?**
It's one of the most approachable instruments - easier than guitar to start with, but capable of beautiful music. Plus, as Jake Shimabukuro said, "If everyone played the ukulele, the world would be a better place."
