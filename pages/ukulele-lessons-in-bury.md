## What Makes Our Sessions Special

We focus on playing and singing together with small easily digestible portions of music theory to help you on your musical journey. Using our songbooks packed with popular tunes, we create an atmosphere where everyone can contribute, regardless of skill level. You'll learn proper technique, chord progressions, and strumming patterns, but the real magic happens when voices join together.

We are experienced musicians who understand that learning should be enjoyable. We provide instruments if you don't have your own. Sessions are tailored to include insightful content for complete novices and experienced musicians, ensuring everyone progresses at their own pace.

## Community Connections

As Bury locals ourselves, we understand the importance of community spaces. Our sessions help support local venues while creating connections between neighbours. We've seen friendships form, confidence grow, and people rediscover their love of music.

We're proud to work alongside other community organisations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire, all focused on bringing people together and improving wellbeing through shared activities.
