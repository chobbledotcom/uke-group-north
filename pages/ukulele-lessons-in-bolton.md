The atmosphere is warm and encouraging, and you'll find yourself looking forward to these weekly gatherings.

Many of our members travel from various towns because they've found something here they couldn't find elsewhere - a place where music brings people together without competition or pressure.

We are experienced musicians who understand that learning should be enjoyable. We provide instruments if you don't have your own. Sessions are tailored to include insightful content for complete novices and experienced musicians, ensuring everyone progresses at their own pace.

**Do I need any musical experience?**
Not at all - we'll teach you everything from how to hold the ukulele to playing your first songs. Many of our members started as complete beginners.

**Is it worth traveling from Bolton?**
Many of our members travel similar distances and wouldn't go anywhere else. The community we've built makes the short journey worthwhile.

**What if I miss sessions?**
Life happens - you're welcome to attend as regularly or occasionally as works for you. No long-term commitments required.

**Are there age limits?**
No age limits at all. We've had everyone from children to folks in their 80s. Music brings all generations together.

**What about parking?**
Wyldes is in Bury town centre with free parking after 6pm. Greenmount Old School has its own car park.

**Do you perform publicly?**
Sometimes! We occasionally arrange small performances for local events, but it's always voluntary and relaxed.

**What songs do you play?**
Our songbooks include everything from folk classics to modern pop hits, all arranged for ukulele. There's something for every taste.

**Can I bring a friend or family member?**
Of course! Many people come with partners, friends, or family members. The more the merrier.

That's completely normal! Everyone was new once, and we pride ourselves on being welcoming. We'll look after you and help you settle in.

It's one of the most approachable instruments - easier than guitar to start with, but capable of beautiful music. Plus, as Jake Shimabukuro said, "If everyone played the ukulele, the world would be a better place."
