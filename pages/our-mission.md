## Our Core Objectives

At Uke Group North, we believe in the transformative power of music to build communities, improve wellbeing, and create lasting connections. Our work is guided by three core objectives:

### Objective A: Improving Mental and Emotional Wellbeing

We aim to improve mental and emotional wellbeing through:

- **Group membership** - Creating a sense of belonging and connection
- **Social circles** - Building and maintaining informal circles of socioemotional reciprocity
- **Mental health support** - Helping reduce mild to moderate anxiety and depression through community engagement
- **Therapeutic benefits** - Providing symptomatic relief through the distractive and routine nature of musical practice

Music therapy has been recognized by NICE guidelines (UK) as beneficial for mental health, particularly in promoting recovery and alleviating negative symptoms. The structured rehearsal routines, learning new skills, and the expressive nature of music-making all contribute to improved mental wellbeing.

### Objective B: Strengthening Community Assets

We work to strengthen community buildings and spaces by:

- Basing our groups within community halls and libraries
- Contributing to their financial sustainability through regular bookings
- Increasing user numbers and community engagement
- Building circles of support within local communities

With the declining number of community spaces, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe in the vital role these buildings play in maintaining communities, individual wellbeing, and social cohesion.

### Objective C: Developing Musical Skills

We help people gain and demonstrate:

- Practical skills in playing the ukulele
- Theoretical knowledge of music
- Performance confidence
- Creative expression through music

## The Power of Music and Community

### Why Music Matters

As renowned figures throughout history have noted:

- *"Without music, life would be a mistake"* - Friedrich Nietzsche
- *"Music is the shorthand of emotion"* - Leo Tolstoy
- *"Music was my refuge. I would crawl into the space between the notes"* - Maya Angelou

### The Importance of Belonging

A sense of belonging is a fundamental human need. Our groups create:

- A space to talk and share experiences
- Connections with others in the community
- Reduced feelings of social isolation
- Increased community safety and engagement

The challenges of recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have created a more disconnected society. We're working to rebuild those vital community connections through the universal language of music.

## Research and Evidence

Our approach is supported by extensive research showing that group music-making:

- Reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression
- Improves overall quality of life
- Enhances social and global functioning
- Provides cognitive benefits
- Creates positive community outcomes

Three Cochrane reviews have demonstrated the positive effects of music therapy, showing improvements in general symptoms including attention, motivation, and reduction of negative symptoms associated with various mental health conditions.
