## About Uke Group North

Uke Group North is a Community Interest Company (CIC) dedicated to improving wellbeing and strengthening communities through inclusive ukulele workshops across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. Since September 2021, we've been creating welcoming spaces where people of all ages and abilities can learn, play, and connect through music.
