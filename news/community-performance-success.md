What an incredible day at the Greater Manchester Autumn Festival! Our ukulele group delivered an outstanding performance that had the whole crowd singing along.

## Highlights from the Day

Over 30 members of Uke Group North took to the stage last Saturday, performing a delightful mix of classic songs and contemporary favorites. The energy was infectious, and the audience participation was beyond our expectations.

## Songs We Performed

Our setlist included:
- "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" 
- "Riptide" by Vance Joy
- "Count on Me" by Bruno Mars
- "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley
- A special medley of Beatles classics

## Thank You to Our Members

A huge thank you to all our members who participated, especially our newest members who performed publicly for the first time. Your courage and enthusiasm made this event truly special.
